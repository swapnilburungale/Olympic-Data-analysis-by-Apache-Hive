# Olympic-Data-analysis-by-Apache-Hive
Olympic data has been analysed to get important insights. Multiple Problem statements have  been designed to extract more information from the data set.
Data is pre processed and is in Excel format, if not we have to clean the data and bring it to processable format(csv, tsv)
Small chunk of data is uploaded where as the actual size is too big.
